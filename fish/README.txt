Design Description:

This design is about a story of "Lady Pink Fish", who wants to keep fit and look better. But on her way to "Green Gate" everyday, she cannot help eating more food (white circle) to turn fatter, but also gets more exercise(yellow circle) to become thinner. Also, some other obstacles(colorful rectangular and circle) will block her sight. Only the right and health shape she has can help her to go through the final "green gate". That's the life! 


The things we learned from last week and incorporate to our codes for our design basically are use of Canvas, gradient elements drawing, calling function of JS, arrays for storing, object literals, constructors, and animation(setInterval) and so on.

Enjoy!
